# Middlewares

This repository contains about Middlewares.

In Express.js, **middleware** refers to functions that have access to the request object (`req`), response object (`res`), and the `next` function in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware functions can perform a variety of tasks, such as 

1. Modifying the request or response objects.
2. Ending the request-response cycle.
3. Calling the next middleware function in the stack.

Route-specific middleware in Express.js refers to middleware functions that are applied only to specific routes or route groups, rather than being used globally across the entire application


The express.json() middleware is a built-in middleware function in Express.js used to parse incoming request bodies that are formatted as JSON. This middleware is essential for handling JSON payloads sent by clients in POST or PUT requests.
